    "This notebook presents a comprehensive scientific pipeline for hierarchical multi-band LSTM forecasting of European Ethanol T2 prices. Our approach integrates cross-scale attention mechanisms, bulletproof statistical evaluation, and production-grade orchestration for time series forecasting at daily, weekly, and monthly resolutions. The methodology builds upon recent advances in hierarchical forecasting, incorporating Bayesian optimization (Optuna), experiment tracking (Weights & Biases), and Azure ML deployment capabilities.\n",

    "## 1. Theoretical Foundations & Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical time series forecasting addresses the challenge of predicting multiple related time series that exhibit natural hierarchical relationships. In our case, we forecast ethanol prices at three temporal resolutions: daily, weekly, and monthly. This approach is grounded in seminal work by **Hyndman et al. (2011)** on hierarchical forecasting and recent advances in deep learning architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our evaluation framework and design philosophy draws primary inspiration from **Makridakis et al. (2022)** in their comprehensive analysis of the M4 forecasting competition findings: \"The M4 Competition: 100,000 time series and 61 forecasting methods\" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10716). This work provides crucial insights into forecasting methodology evaluation and best practices that guide our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theoretical Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchical approach offers several key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coherence Enforcement**: Traditional independent forecasting at different levels often produces incoherent predictions. Our hierarchical architecture ensures mathematical consistency across temporal resolutions through reconciliation mechanisms *(Wickramasuriya et al., 2019)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Information Sharing**: Cross-scale information flow enables the model to leverage patterns at one temporal resolution to improve predictions at others. This is particularly valuable for financial time series where short-term volatility and long-term trends interact *(Rangapuram et al., 2023)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Robustness to Noise**: Aggregation across temporal scales provides natural regularization, reducing overfitting to high-frequency noise while preserving important signal components *(Ben Taieb et al., 2021)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Cross-Scale Attention Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "Our architecture incorporates dual attention mechanisms inspired by recent advances in transformer-based forecasting:\n",
    "\n",

    "Temporal attention enables the model to identify critical time points within the lookback window. This is particularly important for commodity prices, where specific events (e.g., policy announcements, supply shocks) can have lasting impacts *(Zhou et al., 2025)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Time Series Cross-Validation and Rolling Origin\n",
    "\n",
    "Our evaluation framework employs **Time Series Cross-Validation** with **Rolling Origin** methodology, following best practices established by **Bergmeir & BenÃ­tez (2012)** and **Tashman (2000)**. This approach is critical for honest evaluation of forecasting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rolling Origin Cross-Validation\n",
    "The rolling origin approach systematically evaluates model performance across multiple time points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed Window Training**: Each fold uses a fixed-size training window\n",
    "2. **Sequential Validation**: Test sets advance chronologically \n",
    "3. **No Data Leakage**: Strict temporal ordering prevents future information leakage\n",
    "4. **Multiple Forecasting Origins**: Evaluation across different market conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "For a time series of length T, with h-step ahead forecasts:\n",
    "- Training window: t = 1, ..., n\n",
    "- Test window: t = n+1, ..., n+h\n",
    "- Next origin: Training window = 2, ..., n+1; Test = n+2, ..., n+h+1\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures robust evaluation across different market regimes and seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Statistical Testing Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diebold-Mariano Test\n",
    "Our statistical evaluation framework centers on the **Diebold-Mariano (1995)** test for forecast accuracy comparison. The test statistic is:"

    "### 3.1 Data Sources and Raw Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Our preprocessing pipeline handles five primary data streams:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ethanol D2 Daily**: European T2 ethanol price and volume data\n",
    "- **Corn ZC Futures**: Chicago corn futures (primary feedstock)\n",
    "- **WTI Oil Daily**: West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices\n",
    "- **USD/BRL Exchange Rate**: US Dollar to Brazilian Real (major ethanol producer)\n",
    "- **PPI Weekly**: Producer Price Index for ethanol (interpolated to daily)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Critical Preprocessing Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward Fill Strategy\n",
    "All daily series (ethanol, corn, WTI, FX) are forward-filled across non-trading days to maintain temporal consistency. This approach preserves the last known market price during weekends and holidays, following standard financial data preprocessing practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PPI Interpolation  \n",
    "The weekly PPI data undergoes **linear interpolation** to daily frequency as implemented in `merge_all_data()` function. This creates smooth transitions between weekly observations while preserving the underlying trend structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Market Closure Detection\n",
    "A `market_closed` flag is generated when all price-based series (ethanol, corn, WTI) are simultaneously missing, indicating market-wide closures rather than individual asset gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Feature Engineering Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temporal Features\n",
    "- **Event Windows**: Christmas/New Year, Easter, Driving Season (May 15-Jun 14), Corn Harvest (Sep 15-Oct 14)\n",
    "- **Calendar Encoding**: Sine/cosine transformation of day-of-year and day-of-week\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lag Features  \n",
    "7-day and 30-day lagged values for ethanol, corn, WTI, and FX rates, capturing short-term momentum and monthly cyclical patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Return Features\n",
    "1-day log returns computed as `log(P_t) - log(P_{t-1})` for volatility and momentum signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rolling Statistics\n",
    "- 28-day rolling mean and standard deviation for ethanol\n",
    "- 90-day z-score normalization: `(P_t - Î¼_{90}) / Ïƒ_{90}`\n",
    "- Cross-asset spreads: corn/ethanol and WTI/ethanol ratios\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Scaling and Leakage Prevention\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Implementation**: MinMax scaling is fitted **only on pre-2022 training data** and then applied to the entire dataset. This prevents data leakage while ensuring consistent scaling across train/validation/test splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scaler transforms all features to [0,1] range using:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Fit only on training period\n",
    "train_mask = merged[\"date\"] < pd.to_datetime(\"2022-01-01\")\n",
    "scaler = MinMaxScaler().fit(merged.loc[train_mask, feature_columns])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Transform entire dataset  \n",
    "scaled_values = scaler.transform(merged[feature_columns])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is essential for honest out-of-sample evaluation and prevents the common pitfall of future information leakage in scaling."

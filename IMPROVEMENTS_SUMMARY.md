SUMMARY: Improved Statistical Testing and Cross-Validation

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to address the 
statistical testing and cross-validation issues identified in the original code.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Statistical Testing Issues (statistical_testing.py)

#### Problems Found:
❌ DM test used generic lag selection, not specific to forecast horizon h
❌ Harvey-Leybourne-Newbold correction formula was incorrect
❌ No support for custom loss functions beyond squared/absolute
❌ No input alignment checking by forecast origins
❌ No per-origin scalar loss extraction for valid statistical testing

#### Solutions Implemented:
✅ **Proper Horizon Handling**: Long-run variance now uses max(h-1, rule-of-thumb) lags
✅ **Correct HLN Formula**: Implemented the actual formula from Harvey, Leybourne & Newbold (1997)
✅ **Custom Loss Support**: Accept callable loss functions for domain-specific metrics
✅ **Origin Alignment**: Validate forecast origins match between models before testing
✅ **Per-Origin Extraction**: Utilities to extract scalar losses per forecast origin

### 2. Cross-Validation Issues (time_series_cross_validation.py)

#### Problems Found:
❌ CV folds didn't align with RollingOrigin dataset boundaries
❌ Per-fold training data didn't match what RollingOrigin would provide
❌ No per-origin loss extraction for statistical testing
❌ Validation sets weren't properly subset to match forecast origins
❌ No support for custom loss functions in cross-validation

#### Solutions Implemented:
✅ **RollingOrigin Alignment**: CV splits now match exactly with RollingOrigin logic
✅ **Consistent Data Subsets**: Each fold uses the same data subset as RollingOrigin
✅ **Per-Origin Losses**: Extract losses for each forecast origin for DM testing
✅ **Proper Validation**: Validation sets align with forecast origins
✅ **Custom Loss CV**: Support custom loss functions in cross-validation evaluation

### 3. RollingOrigin Integration (timeseries_datamodule.py)

#### Enhancements Added:
✅ **Sample Info Method**: `_get_sample_info()` for detailed sample information
✅ **Compatibility Properties**: `lookback` and `horizon` properties for CV integration
✅ **Cross-Validation Ready**: Enhanced integration with improved CV framework

5. **`timeseries_datamodule.py`** - Enhanced with CV integration methods

## Key Technical Improvements

### Statistical Testing
- **Long-run variance**: `max(h-1, int(4*(n/100)^(2/9)))` lags for h-step forecasts
- **HLN correction**: Proper small-sample bias correction with t-distribution
- **Custom losses**: Support for pinball, custom quantile, domain-specific losses
- **Input validation**: Forecast origin timestamp/index alignment checking
- **Robust estimation**: Positive variance guarantees, numerical stability

### Cross-Validation
- **Fold alignment**: Each CV fold respects RollingOrigin sample boundaries
- **Data consistency**: Training data matches exactly what RollingOrigin provides
- **Origin tracking**: Maintain forecast origin information throughout CV
- **Loss extraction**: Per-fold and per-origin losses for statistical analysis
- **Gap handling**: Configurable gaps between train/val to prevent data leakage

### Integration
- **Seamless workflow**: CV results feed directly into statistical tests
- **Origin preservation**: Forecast origins maintained from CV to DM test
- **Loss consistency**: Same loss functions used in CV and statistical testing
- **Type safety**: Proper typing throughout for better code reliability

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Cross-Validation with Proper Alignment
```python
from improved_cross_validation import ImprovedTimeSeriesCrossValidator

cv = ImprovedTimeSeriesCrossValidator(n_splits=5, cv_type="walk_forward")
cv_results = cv.cross_validate_model(model_class, model_params, rolling_dataset)
```

### 2. Statistical Testing with CV Results
```python
from improved_statistical_testing import ImprovedDieboldMarianoTest

dm_test = ImprovedDieboldMarianoTest("squared")
result = dm_test.test(model1_errors, model2_errors, 
                     forecast_horizon=7, forecast_origins_1=origins1)
```

### 3. Per-Origin Analysis
```python
test_data = extract_cv_results_for_statistical_testing(cv_results, "mse")
per_origin_losses = test_data['per_origin_losses']
```

## Validation and Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
✅ **Type Hints**: Complete type annotations throughout
✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error checking and informative warnings
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and usage examples
✅ **Testing**: Validation tests for all major functionality
✅ **Compatibility**: Works with existing RollingOrigin infrastructure

### Statistical Rigor
✅ **Literature Compliance**: Follows published statistical methodologies
✅ **Small-Sample Robust**: Proper corrections for limited data
✅ **Origin Alignment**: Validates temporal consistency between models
✅ **Custom Metrics**: Extensible to domain-specific loss functions
✅ **Cross-Validation**: Proper fold alignment prevents data leakage

### Performance
✅ **Efficient**: Optimized algorithms for large datasets
✅ **Stable**: Numerical stability guarantees
✅ **Scalable**: Handles multiple models and metrics simultaneously
✅ **Memory Efficient**: Minimal memory overhead
✅ **Fast**: Vectorized operations where possible

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Replace `statistical_testing.py` with `improved_statistical_testing.py`
2. Replace `time_series_cross_validation.py` with `improved_cross_validation.py`
3. Update imports in existing evaluation scripts
4. Test with your actual models and data

### Future Enhancements
1. **Additional Tests**: Implement Model Confidence Set (MCS) test
2. **Bootstrap Methods**: Add bootstrap-based statistical tests
3. **Parallel Processing**: Parallelize cross-validation across folds

## Conclusion

The improved statistical testing and cross-validation framework addresses all 
identified issues while maintaining compatibility with your existing codebase.
The implementation follows best practices from statistical literature and 
provides a robust foundation for model evaluation and comparison.

All code is production-ready, well-tested, and documented with comprehensive
usage examples. The modular design allows for easy extension and customization
to meet specific research or business requirements.
